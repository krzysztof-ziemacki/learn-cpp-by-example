# Learn C++ by Example – Code

This repository contains code I’ve written while working through *Learn C++ by Example* by Frances Buontempo.

The goal of this repo is to document my learning journey as I explore modern C++ through practical examples. Each directory or file corresponds to a specific chapter, section, or concept covered in the book.
